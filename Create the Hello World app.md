### Create the Hello World app
In this task, you will create an app that displays "Hello World" to verify that Android studio is correctly installed, and to learn the basics of developing with Android Studio.

#### Create the app project
- Open **Android Studio** if it is not already opened.
- In the main Welcome to Android Studio window, click Start a new Android Studio project.
- In the Create Android Project window, enter Hello World for the Application name.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        4.Verify that the default Project location is where you want to store your Hello World app and other Android Studio projects, or change it to your preferred directory.

        5.Accept the default android.example.com for Company Domain, or create a unique company domain.
        
  If you are not planning to publish your app, you can accept the default. Be aware that changing the package name of your app later is extra work.

        6.Leave unchecked the options to Include C++ support and Include Kotlin support, and click Next.
        
        7.On the Target Android Devices screen, Phone and Tablet should be selected. Ensure that API 15: Android 4.0.3 IceCreamSandwich is set as the Minimum SDK; if it is not, use the popup menu to set it.
        
        
        
 These are the settings used by the examples in the lessons for this course. As of this writing, these settings make your Hello World app compatible with 97% of Android devices active on the Google Play Store.

        8.Leave unchecked the Include Instant App support and all other options. Then click Next. If your project requires additional components for your chosen target SDK, Android Studio will install them automatically.
        
        9.The Add an Activity window appears. An Activity is a single, focused thing that the user can do. It is a crucial component of any Android app. An Activity typically has a layout associated with it that defines how UI elements appear on a screen. Android Studio provides Activity templates to help you get started. For the Hello World project, choose Empty Activity as shown below, and click Next.
